# CS410_Final_Project - Professional Health Search

## Introduction : 
The system aims to find medical health professionals in the given research areas. The underlying data we are collecting from web crawler from different hospitals like https://nyulangone.org/ and rank it. The code is available here. We are utilizing the common code from Expert Search system (https://github.com/CS410Fall2020/ExpertSearch).
At part of search we will display specialization, doctor and contact information. For Ranking we will use BM25.
